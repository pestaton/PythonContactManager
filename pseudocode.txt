The aim of this document is to help us be on the same page while we are coding this project. This pseudo code should breifly
outline the logic of the program and allow us tobring the various sections together in a coherent manner.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION: **Contact Manager**:

    - Description: Develop a program to manage a list of contacts, each with a name, phone number, and email.

    - Features:

        1- Allow the user to add, remove, search, and edit contacts.

        2- Store contacts in a file and load them at the start of the program.

        3- Implement functions for each operation (e.g., `add_contact()`, `search_contact()`, etc.)

        4- Use exception handling for potential issues like the file not existing or invalid inputs.


PSEUDO CODE:

2- Store contacts in a file and load them at the start of the program.




3- Implement functions for each operation (e.g., `add_contact()`, `search_contact()`, etc.)

There will be four input functions that can be called: add_contact(), search_contact(), remove_contact(), and edit_contact(). 
The input and output variables for the most part be strings or dictionaries

add_contact() 
##### Bryan, please finalize this section as it will help Shuniya with the data storage/handling
1. Ask the user to input the contact name. 

2. Ask the user to input phone number.

3. Ask the user to input email.

4. The above information is stored as a variable/dictionary, then it is added to the contacts file. 

search_contact()
