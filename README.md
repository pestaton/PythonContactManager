Contact Manager inside of python that includes adding infinite contacts that each cotain a name, phone number, and email adress. These contacts can be searched, edited, and removed. The user interface is clean and easy to understand. The project is simple, but runs quickly cleanly and effectively. However, one issue is that when downloading the code it is important to place it into its own new folder as this will be the storage place for all of the contact.txt files.
